# 💖 Project: My First AI Love App

👉 [Live Demo](https://stackmindlab.github.io/project-my-first-AI-love-app/?) 👈

A small love themed web app co-created with AI + my own ideas.  
It’s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and designed to make someone smile, feel special, and maybe even call or text you. ✨

## 🌟 About the Project
This is my first project mixing AI assistance with my personal creativity.  

The app presents a playful Yes / No flow with:
- Cute pet GIFs 🐱🐶  
- Bilingual text (English + Spanish) 🌐  
- A dodging NO button (hard to say no 😉)  
- A confetti celebration when you press YES 🎉  

The vibe is romantic, sweet, and universal you can share it with friends, family, or that special someone to remind them how much they mean to you.

## 🎨 Features
- ✨ Custom messages in English & Spanish  
- 💌 Prompts that express *“I miss you / I need you / you’re special to me”*  
- 📱 Supports share links with query params:  
- `?lang=en` → force English  
- `?name=Chris` → personalize with a name  
- `?tel=15551234567` → enable call/text buttons  
- 🐾 Random cat & puppy GIFs  
- 🎉 **Confetti effect** when YES is clicked  
- 💔 **NO button dodges** on the final step

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation & playful animations (confetti, dodging buttons)
- Using query parameters to personalize an experience
- How to let AI spark ideas while still adding my personal creativity
- That small projects can also be fun, beautiful, and meaningful
